## What is a Decentralized Exchange (DEX)?
A decentralized exchange (DEX) is a cryptocurrency exchange which operates without a central authority, allowing users to conduct transactions directly with one another. This setup enhances security and privacy, and reduces the risks associated with centralized platforms.

## What is Total Value Locked (TVL)?
Total Value Locked (TVL) is a metric that measures the total amount of assets deposited in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. It is often used as an indicator of the overall health and growth of the DeFi ecosystem, reflecting the confidence and commitment of users in these platforms.
Higher TVL values in Solana and Ethereum decentralized exchanges suggest greater adoption and usage, which typically results in an increase in the prices of their respective underlying tokens.
         
## Asset Selection for the Project
### Bitcoin (BTC)
Bitcoin, often seen as the market leader, sets the tone for the performance of other cryptocurrencies. 
Typically, if Bitcoin's performance falters, it negatively impacts the broader market, influencing the performance of all altcoins.

### Ethereum (ETH) & Uniswap (UNI)
Ethereum is the largest Layer 1 (L1) blockchain that supports decentralized finance. 
The leading decentralized exchange is Uniswap. 
The presence of DEXs is vital for our model, which also considers the interplay between another major L1 and its associated DEX.

### Raydium (RAY) & Orca (ORCA)
Raydium and Orca are two of the largest Solana-based DEXs. 
Although Jupiter is emerging, it lacks substantial historical data which is crucial for our analysis. 
The selection of TVL as a metric is strategic; it serves as a good indicator of the health of a blockchain ecosystem like Solana's.

## Why Solana?
I believe Solana represents one of the most undervalued assets in the cryptocurrency space. 
Even if the model developed does not perform as expected, I am confident in Solana's potential for appreciation due to its underlying strengths and growing adoption.
